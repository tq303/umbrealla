## Rushes

- slow blurred shot and show title
- slowly focus and fade out title

- static shot down path
    - animate me getting closer


- blur in/out shot of electronics inside

- animation demonstrating proximity effect
    - shot inside of umbrella, using my hand to show functionality


- multiple illusion of shot side on view of path
    - animate the umbrella spin as I walk past
    - this means they can be off and I can walk past and sync them later


- blur in to multiple illusion shot showing them bunched up in the trees

- static shot down path
    - animate me moving away
